## Data Science Projects [Tasks]

### Task 1: Fake News Detection

**Objective:**  
Develop a text classification model to detect fake news using data science techniques in Python.

**Dataset:**  
[Fake News Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)  
This dataset contains a collection of news articles labeled as either fake or real. It is suitable for training a text classification model to identify fake news.

**Description:**  
This project involves building a text classification model to identify fake news articles. The dataset contains news articles labeled as fake or real. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing the text data to remove noise, standardize text formats, and handle missing values.
- Extracting features using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or BERT embeddings.
- Training a classification model using algorithms like logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector machines.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Task 2: Forest Fire Prediction

**Objective:**  
Develop a model to predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires using data science techniques in Python.

**Dataset:**  
[Algerian Forest Fires Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitinchoudhary012/algerian-forest-fires-dataset)  
This dataset contains information about forest fires in Algeria, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the burned area. It is used to train models for predicting forest fire occurrences and severity.

**Description:**  
This project involves building a predictive model to forecast the occurrence and severity of forest fires. The dataset includes various environmental features that can influence forest fires. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between features and fire occurrences.
- Building a predictive model using algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC score, and mean absolute error (MAE).

### Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using data science techniques in Python.

**Dataset:**  
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
This dataset contains credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine. It includes features derived from PCA, making it suitable for training classification models to detect fraud.

**Description:**  
This project involves developing a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transaction records labeled as fraud or not fraud. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing and normalizing the transaction data to handle imbalances and outliers.
- Handling class imbalance issues using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a classification model using algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
- Implementing additional techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods to improve model accuracy.
